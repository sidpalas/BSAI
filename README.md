# Battleship AI (BSAI)

Rapidly developed a text based battleship game engine and reinforcement learning based AI to play it.

## Getting Started

    0. Clone the repo.
    1. Play the game.

game.py contains all the necessary code to instantiate and run a game of battleship. The only dependency outside of the python standard library is numpy.

There is a basic command line interface to instantiate games.

Single player human game ("Battleship solitaire"):
```
$ python3 game.py --players Human
```

Two player AI vs. AI:
```
$ python3 game.py --players AI AI
```
Three player AI vs. Human vs. AI ("The AI sandwich"):
```
$ THREE PLAYER BATTLESHIP... WAT?
```
The AI in standard games plays completely at random. Hopefully you can beat it.

more to come...
